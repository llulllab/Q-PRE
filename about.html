    <h2>About the Journal</h2>
    <p><strong>Q-PRE: Journal of Combinatorial Practices</strong> is the peer-reviewed journal of Llull Lab, a Paris-based research initiative investigating cultural, scientific, and technological transformations through experimental combinatorics. Rooted in the legacy of <em>ars combinatoria</em>, Q-PRE explores practices of combination—across theory, fieldwork, and prototyping—seeking to articulate new forms of knowledge at the boundary between the cultural and the scientific.</p>

    <p>Q-PRE is published <strong>quarterly</strong> (January, April, July, October) by Llull Lab and operates as an <strong>open-access</strong> platform under a <strong>Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0)</strong>, allowing unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction with appropriate credit.</p>
